    "In Python strings, the backslash \\ is a special character, also called the \"escape\" character. It is used in representing certain whitespace characters: \"\\t\" is a tab, \"\\n\" is a newline, and \"\\r\" is a carriage return. Conversely, prefixing a special character with \\ turns it into an ordinary character."
